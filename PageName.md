# Pomodairo Storage #

The Pomodairo application uses SQLite for storing the Pomodoros and other items. The application will create a pomodairo.db file in your user home directory. This file is currently not deleted when you uninstall the program.

If you download the source you can use the DatabaseViewer application to view the database content.

The content in the database is not encrypted so you should be able to access it with any SQLite compliant tool.

If you have more than one computer you might be intrested in synchronizing the task list between them.

## Changing data location ##
As of version 1.8 there is a configuration option to choose the location of the Pomodairo database file. The default will be your home directory. To change the location, click on menu then advanced option. Click on browse and select a folder where Pomodairo can store the datbase file. The application needs to be restarted before the change will take effect.

**NOTE: If you change the location then the current database file will not be copied, your current tasks will be lost!** You can avoid this by copying the pomodairo-X.X.db from the previous location to the new location.


## Synchronization ##
Choose a folder that is accessible by all computers or use a synchronization application.

A very good fit would probably be [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), just point Pomodairo to a Dropbox folder and you are good to go!

Note that Pomodairo is not designed for multiple concurrent users on a single database.

### What does E P U I stand for? ###
E = Estimated pomodoros
P = Pomodors used so far
U = Unplanned
I = Interruptions

### Why is there a 7 Pomodoro limit per task? ###
According to the author of the Pomodoro technique, all tasks should be broken down to chunks no larger than 5-7 pomodoros. Hence the 7 pomodoro-limit. Reference: http://www.scribd.com/doc/36672142/The-Pomodoro-Technique

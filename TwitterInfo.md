# Pomodairo & Twitter #

### Why would I want this ###
When allowed to post to Twitter, pomodairo will continuously post updates on what task you are working on and when you are on a break. If you are a team working together then this information typically makes is more transparent for your team members when you are busy and when you are free for a question or a cup of coffee.

How to use it is up to you. You can have a joint Twitter account where all of you will post updates (use groupName in Pomodairo twitter config to differentiate between you) or you can have personal accounts and follow each other.

We typically run a common account because it is easier for other people to keep up with what we are actually working on =)

I personally recommend [Destroy Twitter](http://destroytwitter.com/) as Twitter client. It has fast refresh rates and blends in very well with the style of Pomodairo.


### OAuth and credentials ###
The Twitter OAuth tokens are stored in the same SQLite database as the application data. By unchecking the 'enable twitter' checkbox the tokens will be deleted.
